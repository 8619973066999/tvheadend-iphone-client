TVHeadend iPhone Client
=======================

TvhClient is a TVHeadend iPhone Client app, which allows you to get information from a TVHeadend server ( https://github.com/tvheadend/tvheadend ).

It allows you to view channels by tags, view channel EPG's, add and view recordings and view the status of the server.

## Getting the code

    git clone https://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client.git
    cd tvheadend-iphone-client/
    git submodule update --init

#### Background

There's two ways to connect to TVHeadend: HTSP and using the web interface. This app uses the web interface, although it's not officially supported. This way we have more detailed information on some components of the software, like the Status. It was also easier for me, as this is my first iPhone App.
