{"name":"TvhClient","tagline":"TVHeadend iOS Client","body":"TVHeadend iOS Client\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nTvhClient is a TVHeadend iOS (iPhone, iPad) Client app, which allows you to get information from a TVHeadend server ( https://github.com/tvheadend/tvheadend ).\r\n\r\nIt allows you to view channels by tags, view channel EPG's, add and view recordings and view the status of the server.\r\n\r\n## Getting the code\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client.git\r\n    cd tvheadend-iphone-client/\r\n    git submodule update --init\r\n    \r\n    # configure kxmovie and ffmpeg\r\n    cd kxmovie/\r\n    git submodule update --init\r\n    rake\r\n    \r\n    # you need to have gas-preprocessor.pl in /usr/local/bin and have it 777, so \r\n    cp gas-preprocessor.pl /usr/local/bin\r\n    sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/bin/gas-preprocessor.pl \r\n\r\nTo work without kxmovie, remove \"kxmovie frameworks\" from \"Frameworks\" and \"kxmovie\" from Supporting Files/Framework. Then edit TVHChannelListProgramsViewController.m and remove #import \"KxMovieViewController.h\" and comment the whole \"-(void)streamChannel:(NSString*) path\" method.\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\nThere's two ways to connect to TVHeadend: HTSP and using the web interface. This app uses the web interface, although it's not officially supported. This way we have more detailed information on some components of the software, like the Status. It was also easier for me, as this is my first iPhone App. \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis app's source code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. \r\n\r\nClean Icons from Matt Gentile, from icondeposit.com.\r\n\r\nTV Icon from brankic1979.com/icons/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
