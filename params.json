{"name":"TvhClient","tagline":"TVHeadend iOS (iPhone / iPad) Client","body":"TVHeadend iOS Client\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nTvhClient is a TVHeadend iOS (iPhone, iPad) Client app, which allows you to remote control the TVHeadend server  ( https://github.com/tvheadend/tvheadend ) - a DVB receiver, DVR and streaming server.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to list channels, view channel's EPG, search for programs, schedule recordings (DVR) and view the log / status of the server. It will also allow you to easily launch a third party video application to view the channel's streaming video.\r\n\r\nYou can now download the app directly from the App Store!\r\n\r\n[![TvhClient](http://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets/images/web/linkmaker/badge_appstore-lrg.png)](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tvhclient/id638900112?mt=8&uo=4)\r\n\r\nPlease help keep this project alive by donating =)\r\n\r\n[![Donate](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=NA9MHNTAS25NA)\r\n\r\n## Support Pages\r\n\r\n- [FAQ](https://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client/wiki/FAQ)\r\n- [Support](https://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client/wiki/Support)\r\n- [Support Me](https://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client/wiki/Support-Me)\r\n- [Tvheadend transcoding](https://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client/wiki/Tvheadend-Transcoding)\r\n\r\n##Screenshots iPhone\r\n\r\n![Channels](http://a572.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/068/Purple/v4/ed/42/4e/ed424e9c-fee9-fc23-c74f-8d9591766fbd/mzl.dthdmvhr.320x480-75.jpg)\r\n![ChannelPrograms](http://a1437.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/064/Purple2/v4/08/b6/70/08b67026-50bc-bfcb-e68f-b47d0886ccd4/mzl.ekqhetuf.320x480-75.jpg)\r\n![ProgramDetails](http://a1542.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/116/Purple/v4/d7/b5/8f/d7b58fb7-d360-6981-bc04-f1a4c1dd6a88/mzl.fdlipgep.320x480-75.jpg)\r\n![Recordings](http://a404.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/120/Purple/v4/f2/0e/4b/f20e4b51-a2d7-0119-8ae0-99415c6c0633/mzl.xshppebg.320x480-75.jpg)\r\n![Status](http://a1501.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/070/Purple2/v4/a8/ab/b8/a8abb8a1-d052-f8c8-6730-385615f12bf1/mzl.jzfxfbli.320x480-75.jpg)\r\n\r\n##Screenshots iPad\r\n\r\n![Channels](https://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client/blob/screenshots/Screenshots/ipad/channels.png?raw=true)\r\n![ChannelPrograms](https://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client/blob/screenshots/Screenshots/ipad/channelsepg.png?raw=true)\r\n![Recordings](https://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client/blob/screenshots/Screenshots/ipad/recordings.png?raw=true)\r\n![Status](https://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client/blob/screenshots/Screenshots/ipad/status.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n- View tags\r\n- View channel list by tag\r\n- View channel's EPG\r\n- View EPG Program details\r\n- Launch Stream URL with external video app\r\n- Add / view / remove recordings\r\n- Add / view / remove AutoRec\r\n- Status subscriptions and Status adapters\r\n- Log and debug log\r\n- Search EPG\r\n- Multiple Tvheadend servers\r\n- iPad support\r\n\r\n#### Future Features\r\n- SSH tunnel to access tvheadend\r\n- Visual EPG\r\n\r\n## Getting the code\r\n\r\n    git clone --recursive git://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client.git\r\n    cd libssh2-for-iOS\r\n    ./build-all openssl\r\n\r\nDon't forget to have the command line tools installed from Xcode, otherwise libssh2 won't compile.\r\nBuild and run ! Send your patches to me via a pull request ;)\r\n\r\n## Video Streaming\r\n\r\nDownload VLC from the App Store and open the stream with it!\r\n\r\nThere's also an option to use the new alpha transcoding feature from TVHeadend to stream H264/AAC MPEG-TS, compatible with iOS. In order to use transcoding you need TVHeadend 3.5 and enable transcoding support by changing src/plumbing/transcoding.c : 114 variable from 0 to 1. The transcoding is still a very experimental feature.\r\n\r\nIn the future there could be a possibility to add VLC into the app, in order to software decode the stream. Although AC3 won't ever be possible because of patent issues.\r\n\r\n## Technical Background regarding connection to TVHeadend\r\n\r\nThere's two ways to connect to TVHeadend: HTSP and using the web interface. This app uses the web interface, although it's not officially supported. This way we have more detailed information on some components of the software, like the Status. It was also easier for me, as this is my first iPhone App. Also, with SSH tunneling this shouldn't be a problem! \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis app's source code is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2 (MPL-2). \r\n\r\nApp Icon made by Julio Costa Pinto, thanks =)\r\n\r\nClean Icons from Matt Gentile, from icondeposit.com.","google":"UA-38954448-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
