{"name":"TvhClient","tagline":"TVHeadend iOS (iPhone / iPad) Client","body":"TVHeadend iOS Client\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nTvhClient is a TVHeadend iOS (iPhone, iPad) Client app, which allows you to get information from a TVHeadend server ( https://github.com/tvheadend/tvheadend ).\r\n\r\nIt allows you to list channels, view channel EPG's, control recordings (DVR) and view the log / status of the server.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n- View tags\r\n- View channel list by tag\r\n- View channel's EPG\r\n- View EPG Program details\r\n- Launch Stream URL with external video app\r\n- Add / view / remove recordings\r\n- Add / view / remove AutoRec\r\n- Status subscriptions and Status adapters\r\n- Log and debug log\r\n- Search EPG\r\n\r\n#### Future Features\r\n- Multiple Tvheadend servers\r\n- SSH tunnel to access tvheadend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting the code\r\n\r\n    git clone --recursive git://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-iphone-client.git\r\n\r\nGo to TestFlight.com , download SDK and copy libTestFlight.a and TestFlight.h to the TestFlight SDK folder.\r\n\r\nBuild and run ! Send your patches to me via a pull request ;)\r\n\r\n### Adding KXMOVIE\r\n\r\nKxmovie is a library which adds a ffmpeg player to the app. Adding ffmpeg has a lot of drawbacks:\r\n- software only decoding of MPEG2 streams (your iOS device will drain)\r\n- software only for MPEG4 - because tvheadend uses a mkv or TS container\r\n- royalties for AC3\r\n- royalties for MPEG2\r\n- it's just slow, buggy (hangs a lot) and it's not polished enough\r\n- if you can run hardware accelerated MPEG2 / MKV streams, then you can run XBMC which is the right app to do this.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to add kxmovie and test it:\r\n\r\nGet the code:\r\n    \r\n    cd tvheadend-iphone-client/\r\n    git clone --recursive git://github.com/kolyvan/kxmovie.git\r\n    cd kxmovie\r\n    rake\r\n\r\n    # you need to have gas-preprocessor.pl in /usr/local/bin and have it 777, so \r\n    cp gas-preprocessor.pl /usr/local/bin\r\n    sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/bin/gas-preprocessor.pl \r\n\r\nAfter the compilation is finished, drag the following files from kxmovie/kxmovie to the project\r\n- KxMovieViewController.h\r\n- kxmovie.bundle \r\n\r\nGo to Project / Target TvhClient / Build Phases , in the Link Binary With Libraries add all the .a files in kxmovie/output\r\n\r\nUncoment #define KXMOVIE in TVHPlayStreamHelpController.m\r\n\r\n\"Play Stream\" should popup in a red button.\r\n\r\n## Technical Background regarding connection to TVHeadend\r\n\r\nThere's two ways to connect to TVHeadend: HTSP and using the web interface. This app uses the web interface, although it's not officially supported. This way we have more detailed information on some components of the software, like the Status. It was also easier for me, as this is my first iPhone App. I hope the Tvheadend developers don't mind this =) Also, with SSH tunneling this shouldn't be a problem! \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis app's source code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. \r\n\r\nApp Icon made by Julio Pinto, thanks =)\r\n\r\nClean Icons from Matt Gentile, from icondeposit.com.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-38954448-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
